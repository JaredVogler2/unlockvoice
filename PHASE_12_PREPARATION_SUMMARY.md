Better to find bugs in TestFlight than after launch.

### 3. Get Real Beta Testers
Need 50+ diverse users testing. Not just friends.

### 4. Be Patient with App Review
Review can take 1-7 days. Sometimes they ask questions. Respond promptly.

### 5. Prepare Marketing Before Launch
Have announcements ready to post the day it goes live.

## 🚨 Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Mistake 1: Adding Features
**Don't**: Add new features during Phase 12  
**Do**: Ship what you have, add features in v1.1

### ❌ Mistake 2: Rushing Assets
**Don't**: Use low-quality placeholder assets  
**Do**: Invest time in professional-looking icon and symbols

### ❌ Mistake 3: Skipping Beta Testing
**Don't**: Submit directly to App Store  
**Do**: TestFlight with 50+ real users first

### ❌ Mistake 4: Ignoring Legal Requirements
**Don't**: Skip privacy policy or support site  
**Do**: Complete all legal docs properly

### ❌ Mistake 5: Launching Silently
**Don't**: Just submit and hope people find it  
**Do**: Actively market to AAC community
